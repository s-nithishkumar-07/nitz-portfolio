  about: `I'm Nithishkumar — a fresher MERN Stack Developer with a dual passion for code and creative visual arts. 
  
  Growing up in Tamil Nadu, I discovered two loves: the logical elegance of programming and the emotional power of a well-framed photograph. These two worlds collide in everything I create.
  
  As a developer, I build scalable web applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. As a visual artist, I craft cinematic stories through photography and videography that move people.
  
  I believe the best digital experiences are both technically excellent and visually powerful — and that's exactly what I strive to build.`,
